# Lab 1: Capital Investment

## Purpose and Expected Results
*To be able to answer the question: What investment strategy would you propose if your job were to manage 1 Million pesos?*

Case: You have 1 million pesos, you have two options to invest them. On the one hand, you can make a Passive Investment of the capital, buying 100% of the capital of securities of an ETF that replicates the Mexican equity market S&P / BMV IPC, which is NAFTRAC. But on the other hand, you can make an Active Capital Investment, by creating a portfolio that has the same assets as the ETF and rebalancing through a specific algorithm.

For a defined period, obtain 2 time series. The first is the evolution of the capital of your Passive Investment strategy, and the second is the evolution of the capital of your Active Investment strategy. Also, a table with the history of all the operations that are carried out in your Active Investment strategy, and a comparative table with Performance Attribution Metrics, to have a financial comparison between both investment strategy options.

## Install dependencies

Install all the dependencies stated in the requirements.txt file, just run the following command in terminal:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
Or you can manually install one by one using the name and version in the file.

## Funcionalities

With this project, using the __[**iShares NAFTRAC**](https://www.blackrock.com/mx/intermediarios/productos/251895/ishares-naftrac-fund) historic files__ from 2018 to 2020 and __Yahoo Finance__ prices for the NAFTRAC's Mexican stocks, you can compare what would be your capital using a Passive Investment strategy vs using an Active Investment strategy:

Also, you can track the ETF's weights, the NAFTRAC, to the last business day:

And which are the main sectors in this ETF of Mexican stocks.

```
- show is a boolean to determine if fig.show() should be called.

### To get the active investment operations history:
