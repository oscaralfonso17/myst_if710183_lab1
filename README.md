# Lab 1: Capital Investment

## Purpose and Expected Results
*To be able to answer the question: What investment strategy would you propose if your job were to manage 1 Million pesos?*

Case: You have 1 million pesos, you have two options to invest them. On the one hand, you can make a Passive Investment of the capital, buying 100% of the capital of securities of an ETF that replicates the Mexican equity market S&P / BMV IPC, which is NAFTRAC. But on the other hand, you can make an Active Capital Investment, by creating a portfolio that has the same assets as the ETF and rebalancing through a specific algorithm.

For a defined period, obtain 2 time series. The first is the evolution of the capital of your Passive Investment strategy, and the second is the evolution of the capital of your Active Investment strategy. Also, a table with the history of all the operations that are carried out in your Active Investment strategy, and a comparative table with Performance Attribution Metrics, to have a financial comparison between both investment strategy options.
